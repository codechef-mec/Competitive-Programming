Workflow Document
------------------

This document contains instructions on how to submit your solutions/changes to the repository.

### Submitting a solution

Initial Steps :

- Create a new branch in your forked repository
- Create a new folder under the directory `solutions` with your GitHub username as the folder name
- Create a README.md file inside this folder with basic information about yourself.
- Submit a Pull Request for us to merge this branch with our master.
- Once the pull request has been merged, you can delete this branch from your fork and sync your master.

Submitting :

- Create a new branch for each solution you wish to submit.
- Once you feel you've reached a solution, add it to a folder in the same structure as the `questions` folder.
- This file should be in the same subdirectory as the question for which this file is intended (in the questions directory) and the filename should be `<question-number>.py` or whatever extension, based on your preferred programming language.
- Submit a pull request with the following details :
 - github username :
 - full name :
 - class : 
 - details regarding pull request (question number, solution language, whether full solution or partial etc.)
 - additional comments :
- Notify one of the admins if the pull request has not been merged even after a week.
- Once the Pull Request has been merged, you can delete this branch and start a new branch for attempting the next question.

###### Note : You can have multiple branches for attempting multiple questions simultaneously, but make sure no conflicts occur when submitting the PRs.

### Suggesting a change

If you feel you can improve this repository or contribute to it in any way (even a simple change in documentation), follow the steps detailed below :

- Create an Issue detailing the change intended and how you plan to proceed with making the changes.
- If we feel the change is necessary, we will assign you the issue and you can start working on it in the same workflow above *(branch, PR, delete branch)*
- The PR should contain the following line at the top : 
``` Fixes #XXX``` where ```XXX``` references the issue that you raised earlier. Also, detail what all changes have been made and possible shortcomings (if any) of the commits.
